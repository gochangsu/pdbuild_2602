# Lotto Number Generator App

## Overview

A simple, stylish web application to generate random lottery numbers. The app will provide a clean, intuitive interface for users to get their lucky numbers with a single click.

## Project Outline

### Styling and Design (style.css)

*   **Layout:** A centered, card-based design that is clean and easy to navigate.
*   **Color Palette:** A modern and energetic color scheme. The background will have a subtle texture.
*   **Typography:** Clear, legible fonts with a strong visual hierarchy.
*   **Effects:**
    *   A "lifted" look for the main content card with multi-layered drop shadows.
    *   An interactive "glow" effect on the number generation button.
    *   Smooth animations when the numbers are generated and displayed.
*   **Responsiveness:** The layout will be fully responsive, adapting to both mobile and desktop screens.

### Application Features (main.js)

*   **Number Generation:**
    *   Generate a set of 6 unique random numbers from 1 to 45.
    *   The generated numbers will be sorted in ascending order for easy reading.
*   **Interactivity:**
    *   A single, clear call-to-action button to trigger the number generation.
    *   The newly generated numbers will be displayed with an animation.

### Architecture (index.html)

*   **Structure:**
    *   A main container to hold the application.
    *   A title and a short description.
    *   A dedicated area to display the generated lottery numbers.
    *   A button to initiate the number generation.
*   **Accessibility:** The app will be built with accessibility in mind, using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.
